<h2>Continuous Integration</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a
team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least
daily</p>

<p>--<a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html">Martin Fowler</a></p>

<h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Continuous delivery is a software development methodology where the release
process is automated. Every software change is automatically built, tested,
and deployed to production</p>

<p>--<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/latest/userguide/concepts.html#concepts-continuous-delivery-integration">AWS CodeDeploy</a></p>

<h2>Technically no</h2>

<h2>Theory</h2>

<p>The theory is that CI just checks your code against everyone elses and the CD
will run a full build/test cycle in addition to a release cycle</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>
